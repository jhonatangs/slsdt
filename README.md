# SLSDT - Stochastic Local Search Decision Tree

Oblique Decision Tree is a algorithm for induction a machine learning method called decision tree using oblique approach.
SLSDT is a method for induction oblique decision trees using stochastic local search method called Late Acceptance Hill-Climbing (LAHC).
