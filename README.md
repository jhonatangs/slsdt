# SLSDT - Stochastic Local Search Decision Tree

This repository is for my first scientific initiation project.

## About

Oblique Decision Tree is a algorithm for induction a machine learning method called decision tree using oblique approach.

SLSDT is a method for induction oblique decision trees using stochastic local search method called Late Acceptance Hill-Climbing (LAHC).

This project also provides a utility to read csv files and convert to the format accepted by the SLSDT method.
